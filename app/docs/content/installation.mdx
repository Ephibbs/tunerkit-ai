## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install backless-ai
```

### Client Initialization

Backless AI provides two methods to initialize the client:

1. For public (unauthenticated) access:
Users of public projects are tracked through their IP addresses.
```javascript
import { getPublicClient } from 'backless-ai';

const client = getPublicClient('your-project-id');
```

2. For authenticated access with Supabase:
```javascript
import { getClientFromSupabase } from 'backless-ai';
import { supabase } from './supabaseClient'; // Your Supabase client

const client = getClientFromSupabase(supabase, 'your-project-id');
```

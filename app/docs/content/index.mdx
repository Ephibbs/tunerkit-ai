} catch (error) {
  console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
}
```

### Streaming Completions

```javascript
import { getPublicClient } from 'backless-ai';

const client = getPublicClient('your-project-id');

const onData = (data) => {
  console.log("Received data:", data);
};

try {
  await client.getCompletionStream(
    {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        { role: "user", content: "Tell me a story." }
